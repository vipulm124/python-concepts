The emotions lean positive/neutral, fitting a casual selfie.- **Limitations**: Emotion detection isn't 100% accurate as it can vary by cultural context, lighting, or subtle expressions. If the image is processed with AI tools (e.g., Google Cloud Vision or Microsoft Azure Face API), results might slightly differ.  **Background/Non-Prominent Faces**: There's a small face in the background (approx. x=650, y=250, width=30, height=30) of a person sitting on a bench—emotion unclear (neutral?), but its too distant for reliable analysis. If you provide the exact image resolution or need more precise coordinates (e.g., via a tool like OpenCV), I can refine this. If you'd like me to analyze for other attributes (e.g., age, gender probabilities), let me know!"
